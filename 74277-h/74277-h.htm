<p class="ph2">BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE, long ago, in a certain city whose name is
forgotten, there lived a merchant-master. He had
three sons and three daughters, but his wife was dead.
The man was happy in his children; for the sons were
well-grown and brave, and the daughters beautiful. Men
called both elder maidens passing fair. One, like dusky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
night, black-haired and brown-eyed—the other, bright as
the morning, with long tresses of red gold. But the
third daughter, born years later, outshone both in her
perfect loveliness. Such a lovely maid was never seen—so
they named her simply, Beauty. No fairy godmother
came with gifts to call her so; but she grew so sweet
and lovely, that in the city where she dwelt they knew
her by no other name. Howbeit, many a one said, it was
but her happy, innocent soul that gave the sunshine to
her face. Sometimes it would happen, that one of the
great masters in painting or sculpture of those old times,
journeying through that place, and beholding her pass
down the street, would beseech her to stay a while, that
with pencil or with chisel, he might do some image of
that gracious, lovesome mien, to make him glad in after
days. And thus, it may be, Beauty lives still under the
dimness of some old canvas—the St. Catherine or the
Virgin Mother of some Holy Family—or smiles may-be, in
the carven face of an angel, in the niche beside some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
old cathedral door. Even from the time when she was
a little child, Beauty possessed the gift of a loving heart.
And the love she so freely gave, was paid back to her
again in full measure. They who were despised and ugly,
in their wretchedness wanted never a kind word or look
from her, nor were unholpen by her in their need. Most
tenderly she loved all God’s suffering creatures, whether
of bird or beast; she took them to her heart, and made
joy to soothe and comfort them. And she withheld not
her small hand from succouring the most ill-favoured of
earth’s children. Self-forgetful, in her large charity, she
tended even herbs, and such unlovely, blossomless, and
scentless plants, as might call for her tender care. And
the child would oftentimes fetch water for some poor
neglected weed, fainting in the hot sun, or stay to prop
some weak climbing plant torn down by the rough wind.
And Beauty was greatly beloved; and notwithstanding
that she never knew a mother’s love, her child days went
lightly by, and the rose-light of her own sweet joyous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
spirit shone back to her from all things round. But as
the maiden grew from infancy into youth, her meek heart
was pained by her sisters’ pride and arrogance. Many
were the sharp cruel words she heard; many a hard
rebuke must she endure from that ungentle pair. Their
pride and hardness knew no end. Vain were they of
their many lovers, of their gold-embroidered gowns, of
their goodly persons; for well they wist that of all fair
women thereabout,—but for their young sister,—they were
held peerless. So they envied Beauty the lovely face
that God gave her, and the love her kindness won for
her. Noble youths sought many a time to gain in
marriage one or another of them; but none seemed great
enough, or rich enough. Yet they would not let them
go, but with half smiles and double words, kept the
young men following in their train.</p>

</div>


<p>Time sped quickly in the rich city where the merchant
dwelt. Day and night the hours danced on to
the sound of music and feasting. Beauty’s sisters reigned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>like queens amid their young companions,—damsels nigh
as fair as they,—but of whom they made not much
account, for the splendour of the merchant’s daughters
cast a cold shadow all around.</p>

<p>On great feast days, when the house was set in order,
and the sisters in their rich apparel, and gold crowns
upon their heads, sat under silken canopies, with all their
lovers at their feet, right glad were they when Beauty
sat not with them. At such times the girl, in the glory
of her lustrous loveliness, would call the children, to come
forth into the fields and woods, and gather flowers with
her; or perchance she might steal away to succour in their
distress, poor miserable ones, who lay sick and forlorn of
hope, in rude dwellings beyond the city walls. Then were
the sisters left to reign alone; and no prayer did they
ever make to Beauty, for her to share the joyance of
such festal days.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="flower">
</div>

<p>But that sweet maiden gave no heed at all to such
unkindness. She would seek flowers of rare bloom, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>therewith weave garlands and set them in her sisters’ hair,
all unaware that meanwhile sharp stings of envious hatred
stung them, when they marked how men’s faces lit up
with gladness whenever Beauty passed by, clad only in
her simple gown. And so neglect and unkindness did
not touch her gentle life. And home was beyond all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
things dear to her, for the great love and reverence
she bore her father. Dearer moreover than aught else
beside, save only his gold (which was indeed no hoarded
wealth), was the youngest born to him. Yet the prince-merchant
took most delight withal, in his many-oared
galleys and full-sailed ships, which ever and anon went
out across the harbour bar, and in due course came back
into port gold-laden, and heavy with precious merchandise
from lands beyond the sunrise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="fairy">
</div>

<p>But Fortune is not always kind, and there be many
winds both fair and foul; and black days there be, when
the Fates send forth a wind, which blows no good to
any living soul. So fared it with the merchant. For on
a day, watchers upon the high watch-tower, out-worn with
long waiting, and with gazing seawards in vain, heard the
clatter of iron shoes upon the beaten way below. And
anon came messengers on swift coursers from some outland
place, who did their message, and cried out to the men to
cease their watch, for that the ships would return no more.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>They told how fierce storms had arisen, and had so
buffeted the ships that they drove right upon the rocks;
the heavy cargo sank down, and all had perished in the
sea. Thus sorrow and a great heaviness fell upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
merchant and all his house. The elder daughters slept
not, nor ate, for two days and two nights. No more
dreams of pride for them. No more days of idle joy.
Fortune hid her face, and the world hid hers, for it had
come to pass that the rich man, was on a sudden, poor.
The suitors melted away, every one, like ghosts at cockcrow.
And not one had said, “Stay with us; my home
is thine.” Beauty, it is true, might abide in that city, a
well-loved, honoured wife; but ruin and unhappiness had
crept up to the door, and, like a deadly snake, enfolded
all her father’s house: and she cared not to live at ease,
when they who were dear to her, might scarce have
bread to eat. Her brothers knit their brows, and spake
no word good or bad; only, they laid by in the great
painted chest, their swords, and gay clothing of furred
mantles and plumed caps, and went to toil in the fields.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="thistle">
</div>

<p>Leagues away, on a barren sandy ridge above the
sea, in long-past years, the sea-kings had built them a
stronghold. Little of it now had fire and war and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
time’s long decay left whole, save one tempest-shaken
tower. And under the tower a village, where dwelt rude
fisher folk. A poor place withal for he who was once a
rich lord! A possession that no man might take much
pride in. But thither the ruined merchant now must
wend, to make his abode there, and strive to win some
daily bread, in rough toil with the fishing-boats. So the
man with his children departed, and came to dwell in
the tower on the grey hill, amidst of wretched huts. And
what scanty gear they had, was carried on the backs of
one or two hired mules. It was a dark and windy
night, the night when they came there, in the season of
the year that leaves first turn from green to gold, and
barley sheaves stand in the fields, and the vintage is done.
The sun had arisen in the morning when Beauty opened
the old brown door and looked out from under its
low-browed arch. Far down, beyond the curving yellow
sands, lay a great sea-plain, silver bright, glittering in
changeful lights and colour. Up to the roots of the far-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
white mountains, olive woods clothed all the land with
mists of shimmering grey. Corn-fields lay anear, between
long stretches of purple-shadowed forest. And the girl
laughed for gladness of heart, calling aloud to her sisters
to come and behold with her this glorious new wonderland
where Fate had led them. But they, so soon as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
came and stood beside the open door, did but cast one
glance down upon those poverty-stricken huts, below the
steep hard by,—then muttering one to the other, “Better
in our graves than here!” they turned away their faces
from God’s earth and sea: and therewith, through sore
repining and complaint, they both fell sick: and on their
hard beds made what cheer they might with empty
dreams, and lamentation for the goodly days that had been.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/fig8.jpg" alt="pine cone">
</div>

<p>In the old homestead on the hill, the year wore on
merrily, for Beauty made great sunshine in that place.
Her light step and the music of her happy voice seemed
everywhere—all about the house, in the low dark rooms
and up and down the creaking stair. A glory seemed to
shine round her lovely face when you saw it at the door.
Like the wild birds, she was for ever flitting here and
there, and singing as she went. She lent the young
strength of her white arms to the ancient crone who kept
the house. She came wherever she was called. It was
Beauty who drew the water and kneaded the cakes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
led the cows to pasture in the dewy grass-lands in the
morning. It was Beauty who set the table, and made
ready for father and hungry brothers against their return
at evening, from the long day’s work. Right glad and
willing was she, to labour from red dawn to dark, for the
love she bore them. And whatever work she set her
hand to, wheresoever she did any service, all things she
touched seemed nobler, since that she had to do with
them. But greater joy she had otherwhile, on the days
when she was sent to keep goats upon the hill. Strong
and light of foot herself as a young kid, she climbed
the rugged paths among the rocks, following after her
wayward herd. Many a day would she wander with
them through the great woods till the sun was low. But
ever as she went, on the hills under the blue sky, or
through the forest amid the green darkness of noonday,
sea and sky, and sun and shadow, taught the maiden
marvellous things. Many a secret did the wind whisper;
many a strange tale her eyes read in the flowery grass;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
many a song, for her alone, sang the mountain stream,
hurrying over the stones. And when Beauty led home
her flock at sun-down, after such sweet days as these
they noted how, when she crossed the threshold and
came into the dark house-room, her eyes would shine
with a diviner light, than the full health of youth only
might give.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Days and months went by; till in the second winter,
one morning a weary horseman drew rein at the door.
He told that the merchant’s heaviest-laden ship, one of
those long since given up for lost, had on a sudden sailed
into a distant sea-port, and now lay safely anchored in the
bay. Loud were the rejoicings that day within the grey
old tower on the hill. Joy and laughter filled all hearts.
The elder sisters straightway lost themselves in happy
day-dreams of a golden coming time; of a joyous life
to be lived once more, when they should return to the
great rich city. They hastened their father’s quick departure
for the ship; but as needs must, their farewells
were long, for they prayed him to bring back to them
many a rich thing that their hearts desired—jewelled
coifs, and silken gowns and gold-embroidered stuffs; stores
of perfumed gloves and precious stones; and golden
chains, and strings of pearls. Each sister longed after
something better, and of higher price than the other. So
the merchant promised all, and made ready to be gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Then Beauty put up her sweet face to bid farewell, as she
stood beside the horse, and held his stirrup for the
beloved father. And he stooped down to kiss her,
saying, “And wilt thou nought, thou best-loved child?
Choose only what thing is most rare and longed for, it
is granted.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig10.jpg" alt="birds">
</div>

<p>But Beauty whispered, “Bring me a white rose, my
father,—a little white rose!”</p>

<p>And seeing that no words could move her in this,
but that she would have a rose, a white rose, he
promised that and rode away.</p>

<p>So in this changing world the evil days for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
seemed passed away for evermore. It was now winter, and
when that tide drew near that the merchant should come
home, Beauty’s sisters sat all day in the little turret window
watching; or they went pacing up and down the bare
grey ridge, waiting to behold from afar the long train of
laden mules. From early morning, through the glaring
noon-tide, oftentimes till after moonrise, when long shadows
lengthened, still would they keep untiring watch. Small
care indeed had they to see again their father’s face; but
their souls yearned for the gold and the silver and the
treasure he should bring with him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
</div>

<p>Alas! the longed-for hour, when at last it came, was in
no wise like the picture that eager greed had held up
before their minds’ eye. Bad luck still clave fast to the
ill-starred merchant; or so it seemed; for when he came
anear the wished-for harbour, he saw indeed amidst
crowded masts a little smouldering smoke and flame, and
folks running to and fro upon the quay; but his own
good ship with her bales of costly merchandize, he never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
saw. That very night, by misadventure, some spark from
the shipmen’s fire had fallen unheeded, and the ship had
burned down to the edge of the cold water. Thus sore
smitten, and in great heaviness, the merchant must wend
home again. Poor had he left it, and poor must he
return. Full well might cruel fancy now paint for
him—as wearily, with down-bent head, he turned to
fare back the way that he had come—the grief of
such an empty home-coming. “Alas!” he sighed, as
he looked round across the wide wintry plain, “unhappy
that I am! I cannot even take home with me the
one little white rose for Beauty.” And so, very sorrowfully,
did he ride on for many a weary mile, in the rain
and the wind. Lost in troubled thought, he forgot to
mark which way his horse might go. On a sudden the
creaking sound of thick branches overhead, with storms
of dry dead leaves whirled past his face, and many a
wild sound, as of the great north wind in winter battling
with the strong-limbed forest-trees, aroused him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
recalled him to himself. All around seemed strange, and
unlike the road he knew. Painfully for a time the
merchant and his tired beast made head against the
driving blast. The forest path seemed as though it would
never end; the wind blew as though it would never cease.
But at sundown there fell a calm. The dark clouds
broke, and in the clear evening light, the man turned
into a way he deemed that he had gone, once in older
times, under shelter of a grey stone wall. On the right
hand, between straight red bolls of tall fir-trees, shone
the far-off open country. The wall closed in upon the
left; and above the mouldering weed-grown coping, from
within, rose dark cypress spires against the sky. Arbutus
trees, all a-flame with rich ripe fruit amidst gold-green
leaves, tossed down their scarlet balls upon the wet stony
way below. And withal, from the other side came a
great sweetness as of summer roses upon the air; but a
few paces farther on, white roses, like floods of surging
foam, overtopped the high wall. Between the whiteness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>of uncounted roses scarce any green at all might show.
Now as the merchant beheld these foam-white flowers,
he thought on Beauty’s simple wish. Then he cast about
in his mind how to reach up to them; and anon he spied
a quaintly-painted gateway in the wall, and a little door
set therein. Without more ado he dismounted, and
pushing open the little door, passed through into a fairy
garden. Within the greenness of that enchanted space
there was not any more winter. Green paths overhung
by pale-blossomed acacias, led to grassy lawns closed in by
well-clipt hedges of box and rosemary, and broidered all
over with little flowers,—blue, pink, and lilac,—mixt with
the short thick grass. Long narrow terraces rising in green
steps one above the other, set with fruit-trees in full bloom,
made lines of lovely colour. Wild violets crept fragrantly
about their roots, or hung in purple draperies from step
to step. Under the shadowy dark-stemmed trees blood-red
lilies burnt with a sultry glow. Here and there, in
the blackness of some deeper gloom, pure star-like flowers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
poised on tall slender stalks, gleamed white and ghostly.
But everywhere about that garden, roses grew and
bloomed, scattering their delicate petals upon the grass.
Through the silence came a low murmuring of unseen
waters; the thrush sang hidden amid thick leaves.
The man scarce could tell if all the sweetness of that
place were truth, or but woven magic. How this might
be seemed nought to him, so he might pluck a living
rose or two for Beauty. Yet he trod lightly, lest a spell
should snap, and the dream melt away, leaving him alone
in some drear bleak waste.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig12.jpg" alt="flowers">
</div>

<p>But as he held the plucked flowers in his hand, a
dread of some nameless unknown thing began to chill
the man’s heart. Night seemed gathering round. The
loud birds ceased their music; the merry-voiced fountains
ran dully; and a shuddering dreadful sound, creeping up
a-nigh him, turned all his blood to ice. The heavy
dragging rustle as of some huge beast beneath the trees,
became at length a grizzly shape, on the open green.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
The man was ’ware of great blackness and the grating
of teeth. What more he could never tell, for betwixt
the strange darkness and his mortal fear, standing there
unarmed,—nought in his right hand but some stolen roses,—sight
failed him. Then the Beast stayed still, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
roses dropt from the man’s grasp; and that Beast spake
in a voice which was terrible to hearken to, so shaken
was it by despair and rage.</p>

<p>“Who, wretched man! art thou, that darest enter here
and steal my roses? Meet were it did I slay thee there
where thou standest!”</p>

<p>But now the merchant, in whose breast there beat
no woman’s heart, gat together all his strength and wit.
So he turned and faced the Beast.</p>

<p>“That were poorly done, fair sir,” said he, “to slay
an unarmed man—one, too, less mighty than thyself.
The child shall yet win sweeter flowers than these; take
back thy roses and let me be gone.” And he cast down
the flowers, and spurned them with his foot.</p>

<p>But the Beast’s wrath on a sudden changed, as with
a grievous voice he groaned, “For whom, then, art thou
thus lost?”</p>

<p class="caption">Upon the strange prickly leaves, some</p>
<p class="caption">one had curiously carved Beauty’s name.... The</p>
<p class="caption">Beast came near, and the roses fell</p>
<p class="caption">from his grasp.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figx.jpg" alt="dec">
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the man told him all; of his bootless journey
to the distant seaport,—of how his eldest daughters had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>desired jewels and gold raiment, and of Beauty’s wish for
one white rose.</p>

<p>Silently, the Beast heard; then, drawing a deep
breath, like a human sigh, he spake again very softly.
“Merchant,” he said, “death is the price they pay who
steal that without which life to me were one long
death. But if life still to thee is sweet, thou must
bring hither that young maid of whom thou spakest.
Half a year will I await her coming; but if she come
not then, in thine own house will I seek her, and little
more joy will life hold then for thee or her. So get thee
gone, and take this rose for Beauty.” With that the
Beast brake off a rose, and thrust it into the merchant’s
hand, who, for a moment stood still, and heard in the
glimmering twilight that huge creature depart, crashing and
sliding backward amid the trees. Then the man, dazed
and bewildered, hasted back to the little door in the wall.
Hard by stood the chestnut horse, tied to a tree,
watchful and impatient. On the earth lay a white thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
covering of snow, and on the snow the morning sun
shone fair. The horse and his rider made good speed
along the echoing white road, till at the border of the
wood the merchant slacked rein, and there, a little way
down the hill before him, he saw the well-known homestead.
The grey ridge and the ancient tower, the curving
shore, and blue sea beyond. And now, slowly pacing down
the steep way, he fell on meditation. Almost he thought
within himself, last night’s strange chance to be a fearsome
dream. But the rose in his hand shot back a terror that
no vision, but indeed a dismal fate, had overtaken him;
and that now, joyless and unholpen must he abide. Wild
thoughts beset him: thoughts of the deep broad water
and safe haven on that other side; deadly thoughts to
make an end of life and misery for him and for the child
he loved. Yet, as day drew on, Care and Fear fled. Hope
once more danced lightly in the man’s soul, for neither
age nor misfortune had yet quite dulled his cheer; and
now, upon the level road, he joyously spurred on to meet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>his children waiting at the door. You may well believe
how with bitter and hard words Beauty’s sisters bemoaned
themselves to see their father’s poor return. No long
train of sumpter mules and servants! Only Beauty was
glad. She laughed gently, and made him joy and sweet
welcome as he kissed her, putting the dear-bought rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
into her hand. But soon must the bitter tale be told.
So with set white face, and amid choking sobs, the father
must confess how with that hateful vow he had sold his
child’s life. But she embraced him in her arms, and with
loving smiles bade him take heart, and put fear from
him; for that although half a year was but a little space
to live, there yet was time for a few happy days, and for
hope, within a while to light upon some escape from
misery. As for the three brothers, they made light of
the matter; but when they knew all the truth, swore
great oaths that their sister should not go.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="ape">
</div>

<p>Days and weeks went quickly by in cloud and sunshine.
Each night the little load of trouble, or it might
be peace, that the day had gathered, slipped away into
the Great Storehouse, and was forgotten. One wretched
thought only remained in the darkness and silence to
perplex the hapless merchant with a dull surprise and
bewildered dread of what soon or late must come. As
for Beauty, since her father hid within himself the secret
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>terror that after the busy day was done, laid wait and
beset for him the dark hours, she wasted small care
on aught, but how best to make cheer in their poor
house. But ofttimes would a sharp pain strike athwart
the father’s heart, when at evening he wended home from
the fishing or the field. Then, perchance, after the cliff
was climbed, he would look towards Beauty’s casement
in the tower—there, amid bud and blossom, a face
would smile down upon him, fairer than any rose. For in
some old earthen pot, that dear-bought briar had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
set, and it had taken root and grown into a goodly
plant. And Beauty tended it well, and loved her
blooming rose-tree, and never a doubt nor fear of any
deadly Beast beclouded her strong heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="insect">
</div>

<p>But now, when summer-tide was full, on a blue June
day, when his sons were all away in the fields, the man
looked wanly in his young daughter’s face; and she, well
knowing what that was he would say to her, went and
wrapt a grey mantle round her, and set forth with him
to the outward gate. And there she bade farewell to her
sisters, who followed, making some hollow show of false
sorrow. Tenderly her father lifted up the maid and set
her upon a lean rough-coated farm horse, which awaited
them, tied to the gate. And then, leading the horse by
the bridle-rein,—as in a dream,—they fared forth together
on their fateful way. Soon the steep path that had
wound through barren rocks, began to cross the sandy
plain, and before the sun was high, they had passed on
into a beautiful green world of young corn, all bedashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
with jewelled blooms of blue and scarlet and gold,
between the thin-eared ranks. Loud sang under the white
clouds, whole heavenward companies of the quivering,
grey-winged bird. White cottage walls gleamed under
deep thatch, each one in its little close of orchard or of
fragrant walnut-trees. And upon the upland slopes lay
many a fair homestead, half seen amid the crowding
of rich corn-stacks. And so the narrowing way led on
to the storm blown pines and thickets of dwarf oak, which
crowned a dark line of hill above. Slowly they toiled
up the height, for the noonday sun shone hotly down;
and there under the shade the twain stayed a while, and
undid the little store of food they had to eat by the
way, and let their wearied beast go, in the scanty grass
near by. When long shadows stretched over the land,
they were afoot once more. And now the merchant
followed, dumb with a despair that had no words, while
Beauty on her horse went shining through the wood.
Sorrowfully the winds made dole in the leafy boughs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
above their heads. And ever as they went the trees
grew more thick together, with black night down within
the forest depths. Twisted roots crawled serpent-wise
across the path, and needs must the travellers go carefully
and slow. Night drew on, and the man began to
mark the way with care, and sought through the darkness
for the old stone wall, he thought to be not far from
that place. Right so there came to them some glimmer
of moon-litten stone between the trees, anigh the dimness
of their path. And now the long garden wall echoed
back the sound of the iron-shod hoofs. But smooth
and without break seemed that length of ordered stones.
And though the man sought painfully, feeling with his
hands where the shadows fell thickest, yet it seemed he
might never find the little door. Many an odorous wave
of delicious fragrance came over from the other side.
And in the uncertain light, Beauty perceived an over-hanging
of white roses amidst tangled weeds. And
therewithal, as in a dream strange things do happen with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
great ease and likelihood, so whilst yet they sought the
entrance, on a sudden they were within the garden of
the Beast. Light seemed to shine from the far end of a
wide grassy way, and onward to that light, must they go.
After a few paces the travellers came anear the lighted
windows and open gates of a large fair manor. Gently
her father lifted down Beauty from the horse, and leaving
him to go whither he would, they entered, dazzled with
a great silvery blaze of light. These twain were utterly
alone. No sound, no living creature greeted them there.</p>

<p>So in shivering silence, treading lightly in that marble-pillared
place, where the lightest footstep echoed and rang
again, they came to a marvellous painted hall. Beauty
gazed with wonder on the red rose-leaves that strewed
the floor, on the golden hangings and the festal garlands
on the walls, and the banquet spread with care
awaiting them. And because their bodies were faint from
weariness and hunger, they sat them down on the
gold-wrought chairs to make what cheer they might,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
notwithstanding that their very souls were chilled with
dread of the yet unseen presence. So they ate and
drank; and afterwards, as they still sat there, there
seemed to grow upon the air, drawing from distant
corners of the house, and along the corridors, a dreadful
sound, which made them tremble with affright; and the
man knew that the Beast came nigh. So they began to
bid each other farewell. Vainly did the maiden strive
to hide her trouble when that perilous shape came
anear. And first the creature gazed at Beauty, as she
shrank back, clinging to her father, to whom he spake
with a man’s voice, but in slow and halting speech:
“Good friend, ye be welcome, for well and truly ye
have holden your promise.” And then to her—“Beauty,
come you here of your will?”</p>

<p>And she answered quickly, “Yea, in good sooth.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f16">

<p class="captionr">LEIGHTON, BROS.</p>

<p class="caption">The room where Beauty slept.</p>
<p class="caption">At dawn, a lady came to comfort her.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figx.jpg" alt="dec">
</div>
</div>

<p>The Beast seemed well pleased at that. Nevertheless,
in gruesome tones, he required of the merchant to be
gone on the morrow, and that he might never behold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>him any more. Then, with a strange, wistful look at the
girl, of mingled ruth and kindness, from under the shaggy
beast-like brows, he turned from the lighted chamber, and
gat him away to the darkness of his unknown den.</p>

<p>So that night, long after moonset, Beauty and her
father still sat together, hand laid to hand, speaking of
past things, and loth to part—these two, for whom all
the joy of life seemed done—while the lights burned
low and the summer night waned fast. Overmuch
sorrow had made their eyes heavy, and they longed
for some short rest before the coming of the day that
was to bring such bitter parting. Two fair sleeping
rooms they found prepared. And at dawn, in the grey
light, a pale woman, clad in long white raiment, stood
beside Beauty’s bed. She called very softly to the girl,
bidding her have no fear of aught in that place, but to
keep her heart strong and true. Beauty was fain to
tell this dream to her father, that their parting might
not be all too dark and hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig17.jpg" alt="insect">
</div>

<p>When the sun was risen, the merchant looked out,
and saw his horse waiting, saddled, by the door. So
with white set face he made him ready; and as though
constrained by some dreadful fate, he slowly departed,
nor once looked back to the gate, where Beauty stood
in the dewy morning light. There was no red in her
cheek, and her grey eyes were bright with unshed tears,
as from the threshold she watched him go. And so to
her the world became desolate; and yesterday seemed
far away; and full far away and strange, already seemed
to her the familiar faces and sounds of home, as ever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
fainter and fainter came back the ring of horse-hoofs
along the road, and died at last in the distance.</p>

<p>Therewithal Beauty went back into the silent house.
She made no sorrow out of measure, for she was
great of heart; and the young are strong, and slow to
cast hope away. And within her soul also lay a little
hidden hope, most like to prophecy, that even in this
place—where some grizzly death might steal out and
seize her unawares from the dim corners of her prison—she
might light soon upon the golden treasure key,
whereby a door should open on the secret way leading
back to old happier days, or perchance to some undreamed-of,
goodlier world, and her heart should win
its scarce-known, unpronounced desire.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig18.jpg" alt="frog">
</div>

<p>Day followed day, and the girl forgot to call the
Beast’s house her prison. No troublous season of fear
and doubt had she, but only long summer days of
peaceful sweetness, and nights of dreamless sleep. Daily
when the sun went down, and Beauty sat in the golden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>hall at supper, the Beast came and sat there with her;
and his dreadful noise had grown less fearsome in her
ears, and even was as it were, an unheard terror. She
ate and drank, conversing kindly, and heeding little the
ugliness of the presence that sat anear. Each night
after supper, that ill-favoured Beast did ask the lady,
“Would she have him to her husband?” And every
time she made answer, “No—that might she never do.”
And therewith the Beast would hang down his head,
and sigh so dolorously that it were marvel to hear. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>then Beauty grieved very sorely for him, and full fain
was she to pray him to come back, whereas he shuffled
from out of the sight of her. But yet her lips could
never shape fair words which her true heart forbade.</p>

<p class="caption">she said him nay.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/figx.jpg" alt="dec">
</div>
</div>

<p>Days went by, until the added sum of them at last
made three long years: and still Beauty’s life passed
on dreamfully, in the palace of the Beast. But for the
sweet-voiced thrushes and nightingales, which made
melody in the rose-garden without, all day long and
after sun-down,—the silence of that solitude might have
made the girl’s heart sad. Within the dusky pine-branches,
wild doves had their nests, and to her ear
their note had human tones. Often as she listened
would their never-ending love-plaint seem to bring anigh
old home-scenes in that other world, she used, she
thought, to know full well.</p>

<p>After the three twelvemonths—which in that spellbound
place seemed but one summer long—there came
a day when the lonely maid wandered further in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
garden than had been her wont. The gold hem of her
gown slid shining over the daisies and pink petals drifted
down from thorny brakes upon the grass, as she passed
along green paths, to where the flowers and the broad
sunshine ceased. Under the beeches, in the sun-flecked
shade, her feet pressed last year’s crisp brown leaves; hard
by, under a knot of firs, a little thread of clear water, fell
sparkling into a marble basin. And Beauty leaned over
the sculptured edge, while many thoughts both sweet and
bitter, went to and fro across her brain. Down in the
clear pool wavered gleams of some other blue—shadows
of other, not familiar, branching trees; till, as she gazed
into that little shallow, she deemed some picture lay there.
Through the leaves she dimly beheld, as in a very far
distance, an old grey tower, on a sandy ridge, beside the
rippling sea. Coldly shone the distant sunlight on the
tower. The heavy iron-studded door stood wide open;
and there in the weed-grown court browsed the white
goats, or climbed the ruined wall, to reach down wandering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
tendrils of wild vine rooted in the stones. Very solitary
did that old grey tower seem, as, dimmed with gathering
tears, her eyes sought, but all in vain, one whom she
might nowhere find; then, as she gazed steadfastly, a
dead leaf fell and blurred the image, erewhile distinct
and living.</p>

<p>Beauty was passing heavy when she rose and left the
beechen grove. And when, as she moved again along
the fresh grassy pleasance, grey clouds had dulled the
sunshine, and a new fear oppressed her joyous spirit.</p>

<p>That evening-tide, at supper, the Beast might well
discover how the lady strove, but could not, to hide some
sharp grief. Yet so daffish was he withal, that no manner
of cheer could he make her, nor yet require her to say
what had gone amiss; but only might he sit before her in
troubled thought and look askance with down-hung head.</p>

<p>Then at last spake Beauty, in naught misdoubting the
Beast (for he had ever shown himself kind and courteous
to her, like a knight of old time)—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Sir, I fain would go to see my father for a space.
In the little fountain under the fir-tree, I saw an image
of the tower; but my father, nor none else, I could nowhere
see, and therefore I greatly fear for him.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the Beast made great dole; yet he could
in no wise refuse so sweet a one anything she would ask,
were it much or little.</p>

<p>“Full woe am I of your departing,” he said, “for I
fear me sore that you will not come again.”</p>

<p>But Beauty answered again, “I promise you of my
faith; for and I be not sick, that in seven days’ time will
I return.”</p>

<p>Then was the Beast comforted; and he gave her a
golden ring of quaint device, whereon was graven an
unknown word in antique letters. And this ring she was
to lay under her pillow, on the night before the day set
for her return. Then was Beauty cut to the heart when
she heard the Beast groan, as he turned and went his
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>On the morrow that place was empty of her sweet
presence. For when the maiden awoke, all things were
strange about her, and yet remembered well; for she lay
in the low poor sleeping room of old days, in her father’s
tower by the sea. Beside the bed hung great store of
silken gowns, very rich, and well beseen with gold and
silver embroideries, and sewn with pearls and many stones
of price. Ill might such royal weed beseem that poor
dark place, which still she called her home; but since
there was no other, she did on in haste, the meanest
of all that rich apparelling. Then lightly ran down the
tottering stair to greet the beloved father. The merchant,
sitting idle and alone in the house-place, did certainly
hear that which he thought to be a well-known step.
Yet so smitten was he with grief and long solitude, that
scarce he could find will to look up with dull eyes, when
Beauty came anear, and stood in the low arched doorway.
There, for a moment, she made sunlight in the dark
with her lovely face and the sheen of her gold-wrought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
gown. And when she was kneeling at his feet, scarce
indeed might Beauty persuade her father but that she
were some hollow shape, sent of enchantment to mock
his wretchedness; no, scarcely, even when she held him
close, embracing him with loving arms, and had kissed
him a hundred times could he believe it was herself.
And as at last he let yield to joyful welcome, and
with hand clasping hand they sat together,—they each
told other all that had befell since that bitter day they
parted; she, her bootless fears, her days of unhoped
peace; and he, of the elder sisters’ marriages, of the
three brothers gone away with many of that land to
fight for the Holy Sepulchre. And while they made
great joy together, and the aged crone began to set the
board, right so the trampling of horse-hoofs sounded
upon the stones without. Beauty looked out, and beheld
her sisters with their husbands, at the door. Unbidden
guests were they that morn; and with their coming all
the new gladness seemed to die away within the house;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>hearts of those sisters were evil, and in their
hands they brought no blessing. Yet did Beauty strive
to give them such kindly welcoming as she might. Some
pity, indeed, must she give them; for no happy life was
theirs. The elder had espoused a very proud and learned
man, but poor; and by him she was greatly despised.
And the younger had for husband a rich man, of very
seemly person, who cared nought for other goodliness
than his own; and had scorn for his wife, withal she
was so fair. So when they were lighted down from
their horses, and had come into the house, and had
begun to consider their young sister, how she was well
beseen like a princess, in her shining gown, though
serving them with such kindly grace, they were passing
envious; and hatred, like a sharp thorn, pierced through
their jealous hearts. Sore grieved were they when they
knew that to her the Beast was in no wise perilous. But
to her sisters Beauty made but short the tale of how she
fared in that place. So within a while the two sisters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
departed secretly into the green close behind the old
tower, and came to a little hazel-brake anigh the wild;
and there they sat them down and made complaint,
bewailing them with tears and moans.</p>

<p class="caption">But the other was full of learning.</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
</div>

<p>“Now are we in most evil plight,” said they, “that
our sister, younger than we, should go thus apparelled
in silken stuffs, and live in a king’s palace” (for so
they called the house of the Beast). And then they
took secret council one with the other; for they said,
“so we may but prevail to keep her here yet another
seven nights over and above the time she appointed
with the Beast, he will surely be avenged of her
falsehood; and then shall no gold save her life!”</p>

<p>And none heard save only the raven who abode in
the trees. So these two women came softly back into
the house; and they showed unwonted love for their
sister, making much of her, and praying her to forget
their mauger, and the wrong they had done her in the
old days before time past.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p>And the maid, in her guilelessness, heard with joy
their false words. And when the day was almost come
that she should depart they made show of grief, and
besought her to abide with them but one seven nights
longer. Beauty looked to her father; but he covered
his face, and dared say nought, for he was sore afeared
of the Beast’s wroth.</p>

<p>And so for that while Beauty forgot her promise,
and let herself be forsworn, and yielded her will to
those two women, nought witting of their most felon
device. Thus it came to pass that she was well-nigh
lost for the bitter malice of them that wished her
death.</p>

<p>Yet in all these days the maid was not glad; but
greatly troubled when she thought on the Beast. Very
pitiful waxed Beauty’s heart, as she remembered of all
her friend’s goodness, and his sorrow of her departing.
And so it happened, that on the tenth night after, she
dreamed a dream. She beheld the Beast as he lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
a-dying under a great tree in the garden. And the
garden was a very great way off, and she so far away,
she might not help him in his sore need; nor call to
him, nor with tender words hold him back from death.
With that great horror she awoke in the darkness, and
weeping, gave herself the blame.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she said, “my broken faith; alas! that
ever I should have thus forsook my friend; and if
he die, now must I grieve to my life’s end.” Then
she hastily laid her magic ring under the pillow, which
was all wetted with her weeping. And soon for heaviness
she fell on sleep. In the springing of the day
Beauty opened her eyes, and, behold, she lay in the
green-hung chamber wherein she had so greatly longed
to be.</p>

<p>The golden autumn day rose fair and still on the
silent manor and the garden of the Beast. All the long
hours until evensong, must the maiden wait; then he
would show himself, and she would comfort him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
tell him of sweet coming days, wherein she never more
would leave him.</p>

<p>The golden hours sped slowly. Slowly and softly
fell the rose-leaves upon the grass. The song-birds
that day hid in hushed silence, anear the garden bowers
where Beauty sat alone, weaving flowers and fruits and
birds unknown to earth, upon the silken loom. And
evermore the longed-for evening hour drew on. Anon
she heard the clock smite, and she gat her with haste
into the house.</p>

<p>In the hall the table was covered, and Beauty, arrayed
in a broidered gown of red samite, sat in her place and
waited. No fresh garlands behanged the walls, but only
brown and withered leaves. And she wist not anything
of the Beast; and she had no mind to eat and drink,
for a cold dread overcame her that some misadventure
had befallen him, whiles she listened for the least sound
whereby she might know that he approached. But when
he came not within a while, she must needs go seek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
him throughout the manor. But the chambers were
empty, and the garden void, and whenas she called
none answer came. Then she bethought her of the
little fountain in the wood, and she ran thither. There,
indeed, under a pine-tree upon the grass, lay that hapless
Beast in a deadly swoon. And Beauty sank down upon
her knees beside him, and raised his head in her arms;
and it dread her sore but that he were in great peril
of death. And then she grieved, and gave herself
reproach and upbraiding. And, “Oh, dear Beast! what
aileth thee?” she cried. “Alas! that ever he saw me
to have such sorrow.”</p>

<p>But when she had fetched a little water, and had
put it in his mouth, the Beast came to himself. So
he opened his eyes and looked upon the girl full sadly.
And therewithal he said, in a full weak voice, “Alas!
fair maid; why hast thou so long delayed? for now I
fear me I shall die: for I feel well, the deep draughts
of death draw to my heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Then did she make great moan, and besought the
Beast of his love for her not to die and forsake her.
But he seemed as though he heard not; and ever his
breath came slower, and more faint. And then Beauty
fell to weeping as though her heart would break; and
remembering her of all his gentleness and kindness,
and that now he was like to die through her unkindness,
in her anguish she called the Beast her love, her
only love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>With that word there befell a strange adventure.
But one moment agone, the maid had holden in her
arms the Beast’s grim, hairy head; and in her grief she
knew not how it slid away from her embrace. For when
she looked, there was nought but crushed leaves and
grass where the dying Beast had lain. Also a dreamlike
brightness seemed to mingle silverly about the dusk
of evening, as though the moon had risen, or that
starlight trembled upon the gloom. Then all bewildered
and amazed, she deemed that some young prince, clad
in rich clothes, with jewelled mantle and scarlet plume,
stood anear. So, forgetting fear in her trouble, she
prayed him without more ado to tell her, “Had he seen
the Beast? For,” she said, “mine own dear Beast lay
here but now, and like to die, and he is gone, and I
know not where he is become.”</p>

<p class="caption">Ah dear Beast, she said: Alas</p>
<p class="caption">that my unkindness should thus slay thee.</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</div>
</div>

<p>But the strange prince held his peace, and none
answer gave he to her most piteous cry; only he kneeled
down beside the maid, and then full gently did he kiss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>her golden hair, that spread all wide adown her neck, and
then he kissed her red lips; and whenas, wondering and
angered, she drew from him, and would have started
away, he took her in his arms and said, “Oh lovely one,
do you not then know me? Look at me, and see; for
indeed I am that Beast, and he was me!”</p>

<p>But Beauty trembled, nor durst she look; for well
she knew there had been some enchantment; and, sithence,
it was a man and no Beast that spake, yet in his voice,
and in the words he said, she seemed to hearken to the
friend that she had lost erewhile. Then quick tears, but
not of sorrow, filled her eyes, for an unwonted thing
had happened; yet was it to her but as the fulfilment
of some dear dream in old, forgotten, long-past days.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig24.jpg" alt="snail">
</div>

<p>And so, alone together there, amid the brown dusk
of coming night, for a little space, were they silent for
very joy. And then did Beauty, in all maiden trust,
give him, that had been the Beast, her true word, and
promised that she would be his wedded wife. Then he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>lifted her to her feet, and led her home along those
same sweet grassy paths. And as they went, he told her
all the tale of the cruel spell which had bound him since
these many woful years, in that unhappy shape, and how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>nought but a dear maiden’s love might set him free, and
of how great had been his hopeless love for her.</p>

<p>Silently the white moths floated by. The gentle winds
of summer sighed odorously, and stirred the broad hazel-leaves
on either hand the close green alley, as they went;
while loose-petalled roses bloomed and fell in aisles of
overarching sweetness.</p>

<p class="gtb">********</p>

<p>Therewith a great clearness shone around them;
and as they came nigh the house, burning lights shone
from the windows; and there was music, and the noise
of merry voices mingling in songs and laughter. Strange
sounds, long unheard in that still house! Then from the
door the Beast’s mother, a sweet and noble lady, came
forth to meet them; and great joy made she, as she
beheld her son, coming in his own likeness, as he was
or that strange magic was laid on him. And then she
embraced Beauty, and with her heart she made her right
welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>Now the lady was a queen. She was the same that
came afore to Beauty in a dream to comfort her.</p>

<p>Here then endeth the tale; sith it were over-long to
tell of the revels and the dances, and of how the golden
Hall was engarlanded with roses, and of the great feast
held there, on the day that Beauty and the Beast were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>wedded together; nor need we tell, of how the merchant-master
was called from his lonely tower, and came
thither on his fair child’s marriage morn; whenas his
sorrowful days had end for evermore; and of how his
three brave sons became most noble knights, and greatly
renowned for the destroying of many pagan knights and
giants, and of divers fell beasts and griffins of that time.</p>

<p>But Beauty’s sisters, came never near that happy
house. For wit you well, the winter rasure of such-like
cankers, may not approach the green summer, wherein the
flower of true love flourisheth.</p>
